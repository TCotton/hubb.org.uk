        <h3>Wings and wheels event 2017</h3>
        <p>
          We managed to raise Â£52.72 in total but then we minus fees for the
          wings and wheels event. We had a Hubb stall, four of our members
          attended. It was a nice day but quite tiring.

          Every year volunteers in the borough of Havering get recognised for
          their hard work, in 2017 our members were able to be acknowledged and
          received their certificates from the Volunteer Centre. We are also
          very proud of our volunteers for without them there would be no Hubb
          for we are managed entirely by unpaid volunteers.

      <h3>Christmas promotional event - 2016</h3>
      <p>
        On the 16th December, 2016 some of our trustees and committee members
        arrived on a cold morning in Romford for a charity show under the ice
        skating marquee. There were lots of other charities and members of the
        public walked round and spoke to the charity members to find out more,
        we had some visitors and Hazel and hubby stood outside the marquee
        handing out leaflets.
      </p>
      <p>
        We met a friendly dog on our day of which there are some pics. All
        committee and trustee members are wearing our blue sashes

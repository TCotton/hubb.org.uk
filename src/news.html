            the role of (HUBBs) volunteer chair. Having experienced mental
            health issues herself, Rachel knew first-hand the stigma that can
            come with mental illness. (At HUBB) she kept us informed about our
            rights ...&amp; fun activities &amp; events, &amp; helped to find
            speakers &amp; new members. She also found ways to improve in her
            role: she learnt Mental Health First Aid at Havering Adult College
            &amp; became a Health Champion with Tapestry. She will be much
            missed by all.</em

        <h3>FREE Handyman Help!</h3>
        <p>
          Do you need someone to carry out any of those minor but maddening
          repairs and maintenance that need doing at home? Are you a Havering
          tenant ? If so, are you over 60, or frail, vulnerable, or disabled,
          with no family able to help? If the answer to any of these questions
          is yes, you may be eligible for a visit from Handyman Paul or his
          mates. They can, for instance, put up shelves, fix locks and smoke
          alarms and change light bulbs .They cannot do emergency repairs, or
          certain work like gardening, decorating or jobs requiring a ladder. To
          apply: contact your council.

        <h3>MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS DAY Friday 17th May 2019</h3>

          HUBB joined several other local mental health-related charities on
          Friday 17th May in Romford Market to raise awareness of mental health
          issues and the support available locally.Unfortunately, it was the
          coldest and windiest day of the week, with few shoppers about and more
          people manning the stalls than visiting them. We kept each other
          cheerful, but all the stalls packed up by 3.0pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, about a dozen HUBBsters came to help out, leaflets were
          handed out to shops and stall-holders, Gemma brought some cakes for
          us, Michael Inns and Diane Sowten took some photos, Suzana (originally
          from HUBB) was on the Havering Advocacy stall a rare visitor! a couple
          of newcomers said they may join us next month.

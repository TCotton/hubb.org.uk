            <h3>FREE Handyman Help!</h3>
            <p>
              Do you need someone to carry out any of those minor but maddening
              repairs and maintenance that need doing at home? Are you a
              Havering tenant ? If so, are you over 60, or frail, vulnerable, or
              disabled, with no family able to help? If the answer to any of
              these questions is yes, you may be eligible for a visit from
              Handyman Paul or his mates. They can, for instance, put up
              shelves, fix locks and smoke alarms and change light bulbs .They
              cannot do emergency repairs, or certain work like gardening,
              decorating or jobs requiring a ladder. To apply: contact your
              council.

              HUBB joined several other local mental health-related charities on
              Friday 17th May in Romford Market to raise awareness of mental
              health issues and the support available locally.Unfortunately, it
              was the coldest and windiest day of the week, with few shoppers
              about and more people manning the stalls than visiting them. We
              kept each other cheerful, but all the stalls packed up by 3.0pm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, about a dozen HUBBsters came to help out, leaflets
              were handed out to shops and stall-holders, Gemma brought some
              cakes for us, Michael Inns and Diane Sowten took some photos,
              Suzana (originally from HUBB) was on the Havering Advocacy stall a
              rare visitor! a couple of newcomers said they may join us next
              month.

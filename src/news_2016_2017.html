              Our informative monthly newsletter is sent to every HUBB member
              via email (or post for people who do not have access to a PC),
              keeping in touch with those who cannot attend meetings.

            <h3>Wings and wheels event 2017</h3>
            <p>
              We managed to raise Â£52.72 in total but then we minus fees for the
              wings and wheels event. We had a Hubb stall, four of our members
              attended. It was a nice day but quite tiring.

              Every year volunteers in the borough of Havering get recognised
              for their hard work, in 2017 our members were able to be
              acknowledged and received their certificates from the Volunteer
              Centre. We are also very proud of our volunteers for without them
              there would be no Hubb for we are managed entirely by unpaid
              volunteers.

            <h5>Christmas promotional event - 2016</h5>
            <p>
              On the 16th December, 2016 some of our trustees and committee
              members arrived on a cold morning in Romford for a charity show
              under the ice skating marquee. There were lots of other charities
              and members of the public walked round and spoke to the charity
              members to find out more, we had some visitors and Hazel and hubby
              stood outside the marquee handing out leaflets.
            </p>
            <p>
              We met a friendly dog on our day of which there are some pics. All
              committee and trustee members are wearing our blue sashes
